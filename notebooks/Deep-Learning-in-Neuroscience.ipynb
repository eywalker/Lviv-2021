We will then get our hands dirty by taking real neuronal responses recorded from mouse primary visual cortex (V1) as the mouse observes natural images, and developing models to predict these responses. By the end of this course, you will gain basic familiarity in developing deep learning models to predict responses of 1000s of neurons to natural images!\n"
